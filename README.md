# Mountain-Madness
This project was inspired by my personal interest in mountain climbing - the people, the risks, the rewards. This application utilizes the data collected by Himalayan mountain climbing enthusiast and journalist, Elizabeth Hawley. Hawley's database is available publicly online and known as the [The Himalayan Database](http://www.himalayandatabase.com/).

This project is focused on the peaks in the Nepalese Himalayas that are 8000 m or greater because these are considered the most challenging and prestigious. This also allowed for a manageable dataset with fewer null values. 

 ## 1. Prepare the data
### * Download the data
I was able to download the individual Excel files on the members, expeditions and peaks climbed from 1980 to 2017.
### * Select fields for use and Fill in the Gaps
There are many fields included and I cut back the number of fields to make it more manageable for data modeling. The option is there to go back and add additional fields. 
#### Peaks - using Google's Geocoding API, the latitudes and longitudes for each peak were filled in by using the peak name, not every peak was found, so I chose to focus only on the 8000 m peaks to focus the dataset and avoid null values. 
#### Members
#### Expeditions
### * Join and Categorize data

## 2. Run Models

## 3. Design Interface
