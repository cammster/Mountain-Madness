# Mountain-Madness
This project was inspired by my personal interest in mountain climbing - the people, the risks, the rewards. This application utilizes the data collected by Himalayan mountain climbing enthusiast and journalist, Elizabeth Hawley. Hawley's database is available publicly online and known as the [The Himalayan Database](http://www.himalayandatabase.com/).
